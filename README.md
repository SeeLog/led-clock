# What is this?
This is a repository for a LED clock designed to resemble a Nixie tube clock. It is based on the XIAO ESP32-C3 board, although it is a WIP.
The clock can be configured using the Web Bluetooth API. You can set the set the WiFi SSID and password, and then retrieve the time from NTP servers.
